This angular directive allows you to have inline style tag `<style></style>` where the content comes from the angular scope.

# Usage

```
<inline-style ng-controller="MyCtrl" css="css"></inline-style>
```

where *MyCtrl* is a controller where the scope is defined and `css` is a variable defined in *MyCtrl* 's scope.
